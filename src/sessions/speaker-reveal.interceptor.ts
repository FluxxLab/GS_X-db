/**
 * Withholds speaker identities from every response, until they are revealed.
 *
 * This was originally done by calling the service's redaction helper in each
 * controller that returned sessions. That works only for as long as everyone
 * remembers: the rule was a denylist of the four endpoints that happened to
 * exist, and the next endpoint returning a session would have leaked the
 * line-up by default, silently - a leak returns data rather than throwing, so
 * nothing would have failed to tell anyone.
 *
 * Here the default is inverted. Any response containing a `speakers` array is
 * redacted on the way out, wherever it came from, and an endpoint has to leave
 * the HTTP layer entirely to escape it.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not cover, because they return speakers as
 * the top-level resource rather than nested in a session, and "one placeholder
 * per line-up" makes no sense for them: GET /speakers and speaker search. Both
 * return an empty list before the reveal, gated in SessionsService.
