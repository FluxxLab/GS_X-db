 * The participation checklist that unlocks a certificate.

 * connections and discussions - so it queries counts directly through the
 * DataSource rather than wiring five modules' entities into this one. Nothing
 * here writes, so there is no ownership to muddle.
 *
 * Each step is defined by what a delegate actually did, not by a flag someone
 * sets: the certificate says "participation", and this is what makes that claim
 * true rather than decorative.
