/**
 * Drops "translations" that are actually the model's verdict on its input.
 *
 * Given a garbled fragment the translator sometimes writes the target-language
 * equivalent of "this is nonsense" instead of translating - and that lands in
 * the caption panel looking exactly like something the speaker said. A
 * delegate reading Hausa has no way to tell the two apart, which makes this
 * worse than a merely bad translation.
 *
 * Two rounds of prompt work did not stop it, so it is enforced here instead.
 * The prompt is still the first line of defence; this is the one that holds.
 *
 * The check is deliberately narrow. A verdict phrase is only treated as a
 * verdict when the English source contains no such word itself - a speaker who
 * actually says "this is nonsense" must still be translated faithfully. That
 * single condition removes almost all of the false-positive risk.
 *
 * When a line is dropped nothing is shown for that language and the next
 * caption carries on. Silence is recoverable; fabricated speech is not.
